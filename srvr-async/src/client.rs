      A client that just connected can want one of three things:
        (1) Do a Handshake, possibly followed by a ping
        (2) Do a ping or a server-list ping (without a handshake)
        (3) Join the game
      Modern minecraft clients don't ever do (2) and place pretty strict bounds
      on how quickly the server must respond with a pong packet in the case they
      send a ping packet, since it is meant to measure the connection speed.

      In fact, we can't close the connection after the handshake packet in case
      the client wants to send a ping packet, even if the client drops the
      connection (which vanilla clients do) because re-opening the connection to
      receive the ping packet takes too long.

      Therefore, we only close the connection if the reader has confirmed 5 times
      that the client has indeed disconnected.
