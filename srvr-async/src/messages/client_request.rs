/*(Note to future self)
  This request is issued by clients and follows a strict Request-Response
  pattern:
    [Client] --(requests something)--> [Receiver] --(answer)--> [Client]
  When the client sends a request, it attaches a oneshot channel to the request
  to which it will then listen until the Receiver responds.

  To be specific:
    - The [ClientRequest] struct is sent from the Client to the Receiver
    - The message sent by the Client is an [CReqMsg] enum variant
    - The message received by the Client is a result: it receives either an
      [CReqDenied] Error containing the reason why the request was denied, or
      a [CReqRsp] enum variant containing the response.
  
  This struct is used for Request-Response style communication between the client
  and either the server manager OR the world that the client is connected to
