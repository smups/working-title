    Tasks are used to communicate both within a thread (to relay data or

    instructions and basic data).

    The generic task Do(function_ptr) executes the function the function pointer
    is pointing to, provided the context (enum). Generic tasks can only directly
    modify two aspects of the tick loop:
      (1) Add follow-up tasks (this is done via the follow_up borrow)
      (2) Send client-bound packages (done via the stream borrow)
    If more control over the tick-loop is required, a task gets a separate enum
    variant. This amount should be kept to a minimum to prevent unnecessary
    branching.
