//! This module contains all the inner workings of the world generation system,
//! but no actual world generators (keep reading to find out why). This is a
//! highly unsafe part of srvr because world generators are provided as dynamic
//! libraries which require a lot of careful manual memory management to prevent
//! segfaults.
//! 
//! # World Generation System
//! As mentioned previously, srvr uses dynamically loaded rust libraries to
//! provide extendable world generation functionality: users can write their own
//! world generators and plug those into the server (similar to how plugins work,
//! just more complicated and unsafe for performance reasons).
//! 
//! The world generation system consists of the following parts:
//! - **World Generation Libraries** worldgen libs are the core of the world
//! generation system in the sense that they actually provide the chunk generation
//! functionality. They are provided as folders the "./world/generators" directory.
//! A valid world generation folder contains the following components:
//!   - a `world.toml` configuration file
//!   - a `biome.toml` file specifying the biomes that the worldgenerator may
//!   create, together with their properties
//!   - and finally a platform-specific rust binary dynamic library file that 
//!   will be loaded by srvr on startup.
//! - **World Generation Library Manager** the worldgen libs are not self-contained
//! after they are loaded. This is because the worldgen libs provide a ffi
//! function to generate an instance of a `BoxedWorldGenerator` thin trait object.
//! The vtables for these thin trait objects must be stored somewhere. Right now,
//! they're stored as static variables in the plugin binaries. Hence the binaries
//! must not be de-allocated before all instances are dropped. This is the job of
//! the world generation library manager.
//! - **World Generators** finally we have the actual world generators themselves.
//! These are just instances of the `BoxedWorldGenerator` trait object. They provide
//! the actual implementation of the `WorldGenerator` trait.
