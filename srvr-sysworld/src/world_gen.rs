      So, this code is super cursed and wrong and leaks memory. Then again, that
      is probably ok in this case.
      
      We're basically cloning the raw pointer to the vtable of this particular
      GenDyLib trait object. These vtables are stored in a static global variable
      (hey, that's cursed too!) and are never dropped (well, not before the
      programme ends). Therefore, it's essentially always ok to create new pointers
      to these vtables, as long as none of these pointers deallocate the vtable
      (that would break everything).
